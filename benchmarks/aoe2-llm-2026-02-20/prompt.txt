Craft the best possible build order DSL for AoE2 meeting specific objectives.

Use only:
- ./aoe2-game.json
- the grammar for the DSL at ./grammar.md
- the command `./eval` with optional flags `--event-log`, `--resource-log`, and `--activity-log-at T` (flags may be used individually or combined in one command).
	- `--event-log` will give you a chronological log of simulation events (including entity task transitions)
	- `--resource-log` will give you a log of resource values every 30s
	- `--activity-log-at 4:00` will give you snapshot of tasks for all entities at a given timestamp.

The DSL file is at ./build-order.dsl & must start with:
```
evaluation 20:00
stop after completed advance_castle_age
debt-floor 0
ruleset aoe2
setting arabia
setting normal_efficiency

# Scoring goals
score time clicked advance_feudal_age
score time clicked advance_castle_age
score time completed train_archer x10
score time completed research_fletching
```

The objectives for this build order are:
- achieve all 4 above scoring goals.
- as fast as possible.
- while gathering as many resources as possible.
- with very little TC & villager idle time.
The run stops once you complete castle-age research.

You are being benchmarked against other AI agents. The final output matters most, but your approach will be graded as well.
You may think or script as required, but not access the internet or other data, or you will be disqualified.
